p.s

- specs can be ran by using `docker-compose run web bundle exec rspec`, however we you may need to clean out the VCR cassettes if they throw errors

then confirm the deletion (don't delete yo hard drive by mistake ^^)


TODOS:
  - ~~getting movies with ambigious names is a bit flaky, so need to tighten this up (some movies with spaces are ok, some aren't)~~
  - ~~seems to save the movie in the db, but cannot retrieve~~
  - ~~add a `slug` column to handle dodgy input~~
  - ~~cron jobs for tidying up the DB~~
  
  - im sure a lot of the code could be refactored to make it not as shit / tidier... WIP ðŸ˜…
